## Project Description

The repository contains the backend code for a web application called Activise, which was developed as the final project of the MultiMediaTechnology Master's degree programme (abbreviated as "mmp")
The development of the web app took place over a period of two years, from 2020 to 2022.

Activise is a platform designed to bring together individuals with similar interests. The web app provides a space for local leisure providers to manage their course offerings, enabling members to access all relevant information on course profiles, as well as an overview of upcoming courses and trial dates. With precise filters, users can easily navigate the wide range of courses available and find the ones that best suit their interests.

## Project Requirements

The frontend was developed using the React framework, along with ionic UI components and the redux toolkit to manage state effectively.

The backend was developed using the Nestjs framework and implemented a RESTful API. 
Data was stored in a MySQL database. In addition Amazon Web Services (AWS) was leveraged for image storage.
Secure authentication was provided through JSON Web Tokens (JWT). Additionally, Nodemailer was integrated into the server to facilitate email communication.

For version control, GitLab was used, with a pipeline implemented to streamline testing, building, and deployment. 
inally, the University of Applied Sciences Salzburg provided a Git Runner and Hosting to support the development of the project.
